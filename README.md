## About

This repository was created to keep all my work from otus in one place. It helps me maintain all the sources up to date with my knowledge. 

Actually all the tasks had to work with some CI/CD service, but since CircleCI is closed for russian users it's not so easy. I would like to have my own Jenkins server, but now it's just a place for sources which i will update from time to time.
